## Features

- Parses Quake game logs and extracts game data.
- Tracks the total number of kills and player ranking.
- Provides statistics on kills by different means (weapons, etc.).
- Generates detailed match reports for each game.

## Getting Started

To get started with Quake Log Parser, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ziko3000/QuakeLog
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Run the code:

    ```bash
    ts-node parser.ts

    ```
This will process the `qgames.log` file and display detailed game reports in your console.
```

## Customization

You can customize the Quake Log Parser to fit your specific needs. Here are a few ways you can do this:

1. **Changing the Log File Name**: If your game log file has a different name or is located in a different directory, you can modify the `parseAndReport` method in `QuakeLogParser.ts` to accept the desired filename.

2. **Adding More Game Data**: If you want to extract additional data from the game log, you can extend the `GameData` interface in `QuakeLogParser.ts` to include the desired fields. Then, update the `parseLine` method to handle the new data.

3. **Customizing the Report Format**: If you prefer a different format for the match reports, you can modify the `generateMatchReports` method in `QuakeLogParser.ts`. You can also output the reports to a file or integrate them into a web application.

## Examples

Here's an example of the match reports generated by the Quake Log Parser:
{
"game_1": {
"total_kills": 27,
"players": [
"Player1",
"Player2",
"Player3"
],
"kills": {
"Player1": 10,
"Player2": 8,
"Player3": 9
},
"kills_by_means": {
"MOD_RAILGUN": 6,
"MOD_ROCKET": 11,
"MOD_MACHINEGUN": 3,
"MOD_SHOTGUN": 5,
"MOD_GAUNTLET": 2
},
